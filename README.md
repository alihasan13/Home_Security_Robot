# Home_Security_Robot
An object avoidable Microwave motion sensor based in-house security robot.The design of the Robot has led to a perfect solution to housebreaking and burglary. This cheap and portable robot can detect intruder with more than 90% accuracy. A very quick alert though SMS can notify the owner or security person about the ongoing breaking so that certain measures can be taken to prevent such acts. 

The core part of this robot is Microwave sensor which works according to Doppler Effect. Main principle of microwave sensor is the emission of radio frequency. It receives back the frequency very quickly. Any small changes in sending and receiving frequency is stored. We have set a limit to detect the movement of human. This is the main working principle of this Robot.
